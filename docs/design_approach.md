Sales Meeting Insight Bot - Design Approach
Problem & Solution Overview
Challenge: Build an LLM-powered system that analyzes multiple sales call transcripts without vector databases, while managing token limitations and providing accurate responses.
Solution: Dual-stage processing combining LLM semantic extraction with mathematical analysis for intelligent context selection.

Data Structure & Processing Pipeline
Stage 1: LLM Semantic Extraction
Input: Raw transcript chunks (3000 characters)
Output: Structured JSON entities

Extracted Data:
├── speakers: ["Shashwat", "Rohit"]
├── key_topics: ["neural networks", "transformers"] 
├── feedback_given: ["improve on basics", "math is strong"]
├── assignments_given: ["GitHub repo", "24 hours deadline"]
├── financial_mentions: ["$50k budget", "Q4 timeline"]
└── executive_summary: "Technical interview focusing on AI/ML..."
Stage 2: Mathematical Analysis Enhancement
Input: Raw transcript + semantic data
Output: Quantitative metadata for context selection

Mathematical Features:
├── speaker_analysis: {"speaking_ratios": {"Shashwat": 0.58}}
├── content_density: {"technical_density": 0.12}
├── conversation_flow: {"peak_moments": [45, 122, 189]}
└── topic_importance: {"feedback_given": 0.85}
Mathematical Analysis: Core Innovation
The Context Window Problem
Sales transcripts contain 10,000+ characters but LLMs have token limits. Traditional approaches lose information through truncation or exceed context limits.
Mathematical Solution Components
Speaker Pattern Analysis

Purpose: Objective participation measurement without full transcript scanning
Implementation: Regex pattern matching + word count analysis
Result: Instant meeting dynamics understanding

Content Density Metrics

Purpose: Quantify information value of transcript segments
Categories: Technical (12%), Financial (5%), Questions (8%)
Result: Automatic identification of business-critical content

Engagement Peak Detection

Purpose: Identify critical conversation moments mathematically
Factors: Response length, questions, technical terms, financial mentions
Result: LLM receives context from most important segments

Topic Importance Weighting

Purpose: Algorithmic assessment of semantic category relevance
Calculation: Frequency + diversity + content length weights
Result: High-value content prioritized for LLM context

Impact Comparison
Without Mathematical Metadata:
Query: "What feedback was given to Shashwat?"
Process: Random transcript segments → LLM
Result: "No specific feedback found"
Problem: Critical feedback buried in casual conversation
With Mathematical Metadata:
Query: "What feedback was given to Shashwat?" 
Process: Mathematical analysis identifies feedback_given importance = 0.85
Context: Load feedback-focused segments from engagement peaks
Result: "Shashwat received feedback: 'improve on basics' and 'math is strong'"
Scalability & Token Efficiency
Data Compression Strategy

Raw Transcript: 10,000+ characters
Processed Data: 2,000 tokens (5x compression)
Mathematical Metadata: 500 tokens

Processing Flow

Raw Ingestion: Read transcript files from data/transcripts/
Semantic Extraction: LLM extracts structured entities from chunks
Mathematical Analysis: Calculate participation, density, engagement metrics
Data Storage: Combine semantic + mathematical data in JSON
Query Processing: Classify queries and select relevant context using mathematical weights

This mathematical approach achieves high accuracy within token constraints by using quantitative analysis to select optimal context, eliminating the need for vector search while maintaining response quality.
